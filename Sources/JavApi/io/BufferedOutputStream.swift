/**
 * Wraps an existing ``java.io.OutputStream`` and `buffers` the output.
 *
 * Expensive interaction with the underlying input stream is minimized, since
 * most (smaller) requests can be satisfied by accessing the buffer alone. The
 * drawback is that some extra space is required to hold the buffer and that
 * copying takes place when flushing that buffer, but this is usually outweighed
 * by the performance benefits.
 *
 * A typical application pattern for the class looks like this:
 *
 * ```Swift
 * let buf = java.io.BufferedOutputStream(java.io.FileOutputStream("file.swift"));
 * ```
 *
 * see ``java.io.BufferedInputStream``
