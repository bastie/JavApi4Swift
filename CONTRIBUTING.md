## Types of contibution we accept

Before making changes please verify the accepted ways to contribute:

### :lady_beetle: Issues
Issues are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. 

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. 
If it's something new, open an issue. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/bastie/JavApi4Swift/issues) to find one that interests you. 
As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue you want to work on, you are welcome to open a pull request with a fix.
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/bastie/JavApi4Swift/issues/new/choose).


### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests
A pull request is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we have time we merge those changes.

Recommended procedure: 

1. Make changes locally
2. Fork the repository.
3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!
4. Commit your update, the changes once you are happy with them. 
5. Create a pull request, when you're finished with the changes.
6. Celebrate, when your pull request is merged!  :tada::tada: Thanx. Once your pull request is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the project.
