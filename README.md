This project provides a Java like API in 100%-pure Swift instead bridging to Java virtual machine. In result you do not need a Java virtual machine. On the otherside you can port Java code to Swift without Big-Bang step by step.

This project use [MinD](https://sword-lang.org/sword-entwicklungsrichtlinien.html) pattern to reduce dependency and eat other great resources.

Some other projects port parts of Java functionally to Swift. I do not say one project are better than other.

## Usage

When working with XCode add dependency

    https://github.com/bastie/JavApi4Swift.git
    
When working with SwiftPM add dependency

    .package(url: "https://github.com/bastie/JavApi4Swift.git", from: "0.26.1")

or

    .Package(url: "https://github.com/bastie/JavApi4Swift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.26.1"))

## Ports

I'm implementing some porting projects to check JavApi‚Å¥Swift releases and look for the next missing features. The use could start from version 0.4.2.
Check out these projects and learn how to use JavApi‚Å¥Swift.

### 0.4.2

* [ASCII-Data](https://github.com/bastie/ASCII-Data2JavApi.git) is a library to display tables and graphs on command line as ASCII or ANSI.

### 0.7.4

* [LStXML2Code](https://github.com/bastie/LStXML2Code) is a library and CLI to generate source code for German income tax calculation based on Federal Ministry of Finance provided XML Pseudocode.

### 0.8.0

* [iban4j](https://github.com/bastie/iban4j2JavApi) is a library for generation and validation of the International Bank Account Numbers (IBAN ISO_13616) and Business Identifier Codes (BIC ISO_9362).

### 0.12.0

* [ShrinkItArchive](https://github.com/bastie/ShrinkItArchive) is a library for managing Apple ][ ShrinkIt / NuFX archives.

### 0.19.1

* [STar](https://github.com/bastie/STar) is a simple Swift Tar library, that provides an easy way to create and read tar files using.

### 0.26.1

    git remote add importSource ../otherProject
    git pull importSource master --no-rebase --allow-unrelated-histories
    git remote rm importSource
    
    # work on conflicts f.e. in .gitignore
    
    # optional take a look into history

### JavApi style guide

1. The ported Java source code should not to modify more than needed. 
1. I like short lines and so indent is 2 spaces. 
1. Types are in same name files like Java with the exception of java.lang types.
1. The opend curly braces are in the same line.
1. _packages_ are mapped over enums in files named as java.basepackagename.packagename.swift in result of compiler problems with more than one identical files names. 
1. Exported parameters of Java translated, non-private function parameter are marked with underline.
1. Exceptions are mapped over extension of Error enumeration.
1. Default methods are in extensions implemented.
1. Swiftify code are implemented in extensions.
1. All previous points are non-binding recommendations with no binding effect.
